Game Instructions:

    You are a player Ѫ. Your goal is to make it through the gird as fast as possible. In
    order to move, you must roll a dice. After you roll, you will move the number of
    spaces that the dice says. If you run into a б, you will move back two spaces and re-
    start your turn. If you hit a ✸, you must roll a 4 or more to get the obstacle to go away.
    If you roll a 6, the ✸ goes away and you move forward one space. The end is marked
    by a star.
